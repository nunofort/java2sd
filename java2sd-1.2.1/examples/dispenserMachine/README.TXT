PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Implements a dispenser machine selling several products.
                    Each product is available in a distinct location.
                    Each product has a name and a price.
                    The machine accepts the selection of a location and different
                    quantities of money. When the money is sufficient the product can be
                    sold and the machine returns the change.
                    The user can cancel its order and the money is returned.
