PROJECT TITLE: Support for an arithmetic expression 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Inheritance example 
VERSION or DATE: 2005/04/30
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: create a TreeEvaluation Test object
AUTHORS: Joao Paulo Barros
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Add new expressions to the TreeEvaluationTest object. Try the 
to use the code pad (bottom right) to test the evaluation of a new arithmetic expression.
For example, the expression 3.0 + 4.5 is expressed by the folowing Java expression, 
which can be entered in the code pad:
